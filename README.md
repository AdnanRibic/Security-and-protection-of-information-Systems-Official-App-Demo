# Security-and-protection-of-information-Systems-Official-iOS-App-Demo
This is the source code for official app made for Security and protection of information systems. App is written in Objective-C and combined to work with Parse Cloud. This source code is not finished project, just one of the phases of project. Main purpose is for sharing knowledge and to make life easier :)

There is a lot of warning in code, some missing files, but app is fully working and fully functional. You can take any code and du what you want with it. You do not need to give me any credit for anything. However, you will find some 3d party code. In that case you will have to give credit to original authors. There are few more thing that you need to know. In new xcode and ios9, you will have to edit plist file to allow unsecured connections. You can google it and find it easily. Second thing is that app will perfectly work on all devices, but for usage on iPhone 6 plus, you will have to do some tweaking because I made this app way before it came out. There are some API keys, so change them to, do not use mine! :)

P.S. Parse will shutdown in 2017, so be aware of that.
